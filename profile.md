# About Me: Shaun Duval

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shaun, an independent creative professional who's found that sweet spot between human creativity and AI tools. Since 2022, I've been working with clients to create digital art, develop brand identities, and bring creative ideas to life using a mix of traditional skills and cutting-edge AI.

## My Creative Approach

I wouldn't call myself just an "AI user" or a "traditional designer" - I'm somewhere in the middle. My style tends to be:

- **Ethereal and architectural** with a contemplative quality
- Focused on **minimal compositions** with strong focal points
- All about the **interplay of light and shadow**
- Refined with a **personal artistic touch**

It's like having the best of both worlds - the efficiency of AI with the personal touch that only humans can bring.

## What I Offer

Here's what I help clients with:

### Digital Art & Visual Creation
Creating custom artwork for brands, marketing campaigns, websites, or personal projects using Midjourney, Higgsfield, and Pixelmator Pro.

### Brand Identity Development
Building comprehensive visual systems including logos, colors, typography, and brand guidelines. I use a mix of AI tools for exploration and my own expertise for refinement.

### Concept Development & Creative Consulting
Helping clients explore visual directions and develop creative strategies that align with their business goals.

### AI Creative Training
Teaching others how to effectively use AI tools for their own creative work, including custom prompt techniques.

### Video & Motion Graphics
Creating video content and motion graphics using tools like Runway and Midjourney.

## How I Structure My Services

I believe in transparency about how I work with AI, so I offer tiered options that clearly show the balance between AI assistance and human creativity:

### Bronze: AI-Enhanced
- Mostly AI-generated with my direction
- Basic customization
- Quick turnaround (2-3 days)
- Limited revisions (1-2 rounds)
- Budget-friendly option

### Silver: Human-AI Collaboration

- Standard revision process (2-3 rounds)
- Personal creative direction
- Middle-tier pricing

### Gold: Premium Creative Direction

## Who I Work With

I typically partner with digital-first businesses, tech startups, small creative agencies, and solo entrepreneurs who:
- Lack an in-house design team
- Have limited time/budget for content creation
- Feel overwhelmed by AI tools
- Need professional visuals without big agency costs
- Want to stand out from generic AI-generated content

## My Core Values

- **Authenticity**: Being transparent about AI use
- **Human-AI Partnership**: Finding the right balance
- **Continuous Growth**: Always learning new techniques
- **Value Creation**: Focusing on outcomes, not just deliverables
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Taking ownership of creative outputs

## What Makes Me Different

There are three main types of creators in this space:
1. Traditional designers (technical skills but slower and more expensive)
2. DIY brands using AI tools directly (cheap but generic results)
3. Other AI creatives (technical knowledge but often lack strategic thinking)

I bridge these gaps by combining:
- Strategic thinking beyond just tool usage
- The perfect balance of human creativity and AI efficiency
- Client education about the process
- Focus on business outcomes rather than just pretty pictures
