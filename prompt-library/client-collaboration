ðŸ‘¥ Client Collaboration
The Client Collaboration prompts focus on the human side of AI-enhanced creative work. These templates will help you effectively communicate your process, set appropriate expectations, and gather the right information from clients. Use these when onboarding new clients, explaining your AI workflow, developing service packages, or integrating client feedback into your process. They're designed to create transparency, build trust, and establish productive partnerships where clients understand the value you bring beyond the tools you use.
