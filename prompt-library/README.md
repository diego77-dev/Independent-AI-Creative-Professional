## Tips for Effective Prompt Engineering

1. **Be specific** about what you want - vague prompts yield vague results
2. **Use clear parameters** whenever possible (dimensions, style names, etc.)
3. **Provide reference examples** when appropriate
4. **Use negative prompting** to avoid unwanted elements
5. **Iterate gradually** rather than making dramatic changes
6. **Document successful prompts** for future reference
7. **Understand each tool's strengths** and optimize accordingly
8. **Consider the prompt as a conversation** with the AI, not just instructions
9. **Structure prompts clearly** - use separators (### or ---) to distinguish instructions from content
10. **Use chain-of-thought prompting** for complex reasoning tasks by asking the AI to "think step by step"
11. **Try few-shot examples** when you want specific formats or approaches followed
12. **Focus on outputs, not complexity** - sometimes simpler prompts work better
13. **Test variations** of the same prompt to find what works best for each tool
14. **Maintain consistent formatting** within your prompt templates
