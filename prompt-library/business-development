ðŸ’¼ Business Development
The Business Development section contains prompts designed to help you articulate, position, and grow your AI creative business. These templates assist with defining your value proposition, creating service descriptions, developing case studies, and establishing pricing strategies. Use these when you need to explain your unique approach to prospects, differentiate yourself from competitors, or scale your creative practice. They'll help you communicate not just what you do, but why it matters and how it delivers value beyond what clients could achieve on their own.
